You are better off using dialog as jm666 mentioned, but there are other ways to skin that cat.

read -n 1 x; while read -n 1 -t .1 y; do x="$x$y"; done

Basically wait until you read a character and then spin consuming input until .1 seconds has passed w/o input.

Warning, fast typists could get annoyed. You might need to tweak that timeout.
